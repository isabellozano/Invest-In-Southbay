# Project 2: investInSouthBay
_A Full-Stack Real Estate Web Application_

## Overview
This is a full-stack web application that uses the MVC paradigm and a server side API. This app was designed to give the Client a 2.0 version of his exisiting real estate investment company, _InvestInSouthBay.com_, this web app provides functionality by combining the the following links: What's My Home Worth, Sell My Home, Find Me A Home, and Property Management onto one page.

NOTE: The build-out of the updated 2.0 version of the Client's already exisiting website was designed to be completed in two phases:

_Phase One_ consisted of adding website functionality and linking four pages onto one landing page, the Home page. 

_Phase Two_ involves future development of the app's HTML and CSS features, including adding a framework such as _Laravel_, _Angular_, _Ruby on Rails_, or _Django_. _P2_ will also include adding an API - IDX Property Search Tool as well as a Commercial Property page (Each to be provided by the Client).
